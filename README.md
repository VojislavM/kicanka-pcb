kicanka PCB - battery and RGB led PCB in special shape

This was the official badge of my wedding. I created it and assembled 100 pcs for all guests. 
The LED is multicolor and changes color when power is applied. The circuit is really simple, just battery and LED. 

## components:
* battery holder for CR1220 battery
* LED - [5mm slow RGB LED Light](https://www.amazon.com/100pcs-5mm-Light-change-Rainbow/dp/B00P6KYV54)
